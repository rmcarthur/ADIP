*ABSTRACT LOGO FADES IN, THEN OUT*
*VIDEO OF PRODUCT DEMO PLAYS*


Narrator: 
  Hey there, I'm Mo (or Mohammed), CTO & Co-Founder at Abstract. While working with my team to build a robust, reliable product that allows
government affairs experts in California to do their job in a modern, collaborative setting, we've come across a lot of very interesting insights
in the data that we've collected that truly allow us to read between the aisles, data that we think you should be able to learn about to not only
understand the workings of the system that governs our daily lives, but also to make you a more informed californian overall.

This is the first video of a series where we'll be diving deep into how our legislature functions, and what kinds of patterns and trends we overlook until
we re-imagine how data that we work with on a daily basis is displayed, and understood. Without further adue, let's get right into it.

*PRODUCT DEMO FADES OUT*
*FOOTAGE OF VOTE PASSING IN CA LEGISLATURE, AUDIO FADES OUT*

  if you've been keeping an eye on the California Legislature recently, you might've either heard or seen a lot of this.
but, what only a few are able to recognize is how the dynamics between each legislator play out with each vote, and what sort of
insights we can pull out about the relationships between each party here.

  Let's start by pointing out the obvious, there's a reason Californians rarely get phone calls from automated polls around election season,
and that's because since 1992, California has been a super blue state. This is where most people draw the line, but what struck our curiosity here at Abstract was
when this shift began occuring, and what direction this partisan divide is headed in. 

*FOOTAGE OF VOTE BOARDS IN CA LEIGSLATURE*

After scouring our databases for endless hours, what we were able to find out
is that the votes that occur in each session, one of which you just saw, can actually tell us a lot about the lines drawn between and within each party,
and how those lines are changing over time.

*FADE TO BLACK*

  Before we head into the findings, we'll need to understand how they are displayed. It all starts with a table.

*TABLE TEMPLATE DRAWN ON SCREEN*

  say we're looking at the overlaps in vote stances between three senators, Senator X, Senator Y, and Senator Z.

*ROW/COLUMN TABLES POPULATE WITH SENATOR NAMES*

  in a single legislative session, each senator voted on 100 bills. On this table, we can visualize it as such, since you can't really oppose youself in a single vote.

*100s FILL IN DIAGONAL OF TABLE*

  Now, say that among these 100 bills, Senators X and Y voted similarly on 50 of those bills, Senators Y and Z voted similarly on 10 of those bills,
  finally, Senators X and Z voted similarly on 20 bills. These can be envisioned on our table like this

*SAMPLE DATA FILLS TABLE*

  There are many ways we can interpret this table, but let's simplify it even further, we'll try to get away from numbers as much as possible here.

*TABLE FADES OUT, NODES FOR EACH SENATOR APPEAR*

  here are the senators we just saw on that table, senators X, Y, and Z.

*EACH NODE CHANGES COLOR AS THEY ARE BEING CALLED OUT*

  let's assume that senators that voted together 100 times can be linked with a line like this. that hasn't happened though, so we'll get rid of it.

*THICK LINE APPEARS, THEN DISAPPEARS*
  we do have senators X and Y voting together 50 times though, so we'll represent it with a slightly thinner line.

*LINE BETWEEN X AND Y APPEARS*

  using that same logic, we're able to map out the rest of the figures we saw on the table like so

*REST OF LINES APPEAR*

  much better, right? we can clearly see and understand the voting dynamics between each senator in this leigslative session.
  Now, let's spice it up a little...

*SENTORS X AND Y TURN BLUE, SENATOR Z TURNS RED*

  if we revealed to you that senators X and Y were democrats, and Z republican, you'd start to see the partisan divide in your legislature, meaning bipartisan
  efforts might be difficult to come by, and agendas backed by one side will have to fight an uphill battle to end up on the governor's desk.

  now that we know what how to make sense of this data, let's look at the real deal...
